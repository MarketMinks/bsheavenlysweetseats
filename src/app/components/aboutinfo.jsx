        <div className=" text-2xl text-foregroundlight mt-4">Barbara Montgomery is the owner of Bâ€™s Heavenly Sweets & Eats, inspired by her early passion for cooking alongside her grandmother and honed through years of practice and education in Home Economics. She began her business by crafting chocolate-covered strawberries and experimenting with recipes, which quickly expanded into cakes, desserts, and other baked goods due to popular demand. As her culinary offerings grew to include savory dishes, she rebranded her business to reflect both her sweet and savory creations. Today, Barbara delights in sharing her love for cooking and baking by providing delicious meals and desserts for individuals and events.</div>
